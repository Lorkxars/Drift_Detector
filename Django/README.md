# Django
## Requirements
Before running the project, all the packages on the file requirements.txt must be installed (the easiest way is to use the pip command). It is probably a good idea to contain everything on a virtual environment (some instructions here: [venv])

## Configuration
The first thing you might want to do when you finish installing everything is go to core/settings.py and change ALLOWED_HOSTS to be able to access the server when you run it. Additionally if you want to use a different database (currently configured to use sqlite) this is probably the moment to do that too.
